#About the project-
 The Interactive Quiz Application is a responsive, dynamic, and visually appealing web-based quiz game developed using HTML, CSS (Bootstrap 5), and Vanilla JavaScript. The main purpose of this application is to provide users with an engaging and educational platform to test their knowledge across various categories through multiple-choice questions. The application offers real-time feedback, a timed question mechanism, sound-based alerts, and a scoreboard to enhance interactivity and replayability.

Upon launching the app, users are presented with a home screen where they can select from one of the available quiz categories, including Science, Design, Nature, and Technology. Each category contains a unique set of preloaded questions. This modular structure allows easy customization and expansion by simply adding more questions or new categories.

Once a category is selected, the quiz begins with a sleek question interface that features a 15-second countdown timer for each question. This countdown adds urgency and makes the game more thrilling, encouraging users to think quickly and decisively. If the timer runs out before the user selects an answer, the question is marked incorrect, and the correct answer is automatically displayed. This approach is particularly effective in simulating time-bound assessments, making the app useful for students and learners.

Each question is presented with four options. When the user selects an option, instant feedback is given: a green highlight indicates a correct answer, while a red highlight shows a wrong answer. Additionally, the correct answer is displayed if the user's selection was incorrect. This immediate feedback loop helps reinforce learning and makes the quiz informative as well as fun.

To further enrich the user experience, the application includes sound effects. A pleasant chime is played when a correct answer is selected, and a subtle buzzer sound plays on an incorrect choice. These audio cues enhance the interactive experience and keep users engaged throughout the quiz.

After completing all questions in a selected category, the app displays a final scoreboard summarizing the user’s performance (e.g., “Final Score: 3/5”). A clear and friendly message indicates the quiz is complete. To allow repeated play and encourage improvement, a Restart button is prominently displayed, which takes the user back to the category selection screen.

The interface is styled using Bootstrap 5, along with custom CSS, to ensure a modern look and feel. The application uses a gradient background, clean typography, and responsive layout to provide a seamless experience on desktops, tablets, and smartphones. The layout is designed with accessibility and clarity in mind, making the app intuitive even for first-time users.

From a technical standpoint, the app is entirely built in Vanilla JavaScript without external frameworks, making it lightweight and easily customizable. Developers can add new categories, modify questions, or extend features such as local storage, user login, or high-score tracking with minimal effort.

This project is perfect for anyone looking to learn or demonstrate fundamental web development skills, including DOM manipulation, event handling, timers, and responsive design. It also serves as a solid base for building more complex quiz engines or integrating with e-learning platforms.
